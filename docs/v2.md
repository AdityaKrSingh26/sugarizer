Sugarizer v2 is the rewrite of [Sugarizer Core](architecture.md) using Vue.js Options API.

It is a complete rewrite of the previous version of Sugarizer Core, which was based on the deprecated Enyo framework. The goal of this rewrite is to provide a more modern and maintainable codebase, while still preserving the core functionality and features of Sugarizer.

This work was mainly done during GSoC (Saumya Kushwaha in 2022, Vinayak Nayar in 2023, Utkarsh Siddhpura in 2024) and is now merged into the dev branch of Sugarizer.

You can help by testing the new version and reporting differences between the two versions (master and dev branches).
